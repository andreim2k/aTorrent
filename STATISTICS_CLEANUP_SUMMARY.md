- Now uses real data from the backend API

### 2. **Fixed API Endpoints**

- Removed non-existent `/statistics/trends` endpoint
- Now using the correct backend endpoints:
  - `/api/v1/torrents/stats/overview`
  - `/api/v1/torrents/stats/session`

### 3. **Improved UI/UX**
- Added proper loading states for all stat cards
- Added error handling with user-friendly error messages
- Simplified the interface to focus on real, available data
- Added `ClientOnly` wrapper to prevent hydration issues

### 4. **Restructured Data Display**

#### **Torrent Overview Section**
- Total Downloaded (real data from backend)
- Total Uploaded (real data from backend)
- Overall Ratio (calculated from real data)
- Active Torrents count

#### **Current Session Section**
- Real-time Download Rate
- Real-time Upload Rate
- Connected Peers count
- DHT and port information

#### **System Information Section**
- Current transfer rates with animated progress bars
- Session details (DHT nodes, LibTorrent version, port)
- Removed fake disk usage (not available from backend)

### 5. **Technical Improvements**
- Better error handling and fallbacks
- Proper loading states throughout
- More efficient API calls with appropriate refresh intervals
- Type-safe data handling

## ðŸš€ Features Now Working
